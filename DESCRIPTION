Description: Functions to conduct hypothesis tests and derive confidence intervals 
    for quantiles, linear combinations of quantiles, 
    ratios of dependent linear combinations and differences 
    and ratios of all of the above for comparisons between independent samples. 
    Additionally, quantile-based measures of inequality are also considered.
